    "Geological processes at the mid-ocean ridges are responsible for the bulk of the Earth's heat loss and volcanic activity. The compositions of materials erupted at these locations, dominantly mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs), have profound implications for the inner workings of the Earth's mantle, the construction of oceanic crust, and global plate tectonics. In this exercise, students replicate a portion of a classic paper on MORB geochemistry [(Klein and Langmuir, 1987)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JB092iB08p08089), but using a much larger global geochemical dataset downloaded from the PetDB database. Through a series of activities and questions, students are encouraged to think about the petrologic and geodynamic processes controlling the composition of Earth's most abundant volcanic rocks."

    "#### Exploring and sampling the world's mid-ocean ridges\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the mid-20th century, our knowledge of undersea volcanic activity has expanded considerably as portions of the Earth's seafloor have been systematically explored. Dedicated scientific research vessels have obtained thousands of samples of oceanic crust by dredging, drilling, and small submersibles. These samples have been cataloged, analyzed, stored in large archives, and the resulting data has been published widely in the geological literature, contributing to our knowledge of the composition and origin of the oceanic crust. A large amount of these data are now available in digital format from the Petrological Database of the Ocean Floor ([PetDB](https://search.earthchem.org/)), a web-based data management system for geochemical and petrological sample-based data funded by the National Science Foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mid-ocean ridge basalts: the Earth's most voluminous volcanic rocks \n",
    "\n",
    "On a volumetric basis, basaltic lavas erupted under the ocean at mid-ocean ridges are the most important products of terrestrial volcanism. What we have learned from mid-ocean basalts (MORBs) has had tremendous implications for our understanding of large-scale geodynamic and tectonic processes operating within the Earth's core, mantle, and crust.\n",
    "\n",
    "When studying a group of related igneous rocks, an important issue to ascertain is the amount of compositional variation that characterizes the dataset. This is of particular importance for the study of MORB's. Are MORBs relatively uniform in composition, perhaps suggesting partial melting from uniform source materials in the mantle followed by uniform modification by magmatic processes? Alternatively, does the global MORB dataset exhibit significant compositional variation, perhaps suggesting important differences in source materials, melting conditions, or subsequent magmatic processes? A related issue is whether geochemical variation in the MORB dataset is a function of geographic location (e.g., position along the mid-ocean ridge system). This may have important implications for lateral variations in composition, temperature, or pressure within the Earth's mantle. Keep these larger issues in mind as you work through the following exercise.\n"

    "##### 4. It will be of interest now to focus on the geochemical variation among the more primitive MORB liquids, but to do this, we need to find a way to correct for the effects of fractionation. Well, we're in luck! A method of fractionation correction has been developed by [(Klein and Langmuir, 1987)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JB092iB08p08089) which is based on the observation that low-pressure fractionation of a primitive basaltic liquid within an individual volcanic suite (or at a specific location) results in a more-or-less linear array (\"liquid lines of descent\") on major-element variation diagrams, at least over certain ranges of MgO. Because their fractionating mineral assemblages are similar, the slopes of these liquid lines of descent for different igneous suites (or locations) are more or less sub-parallel to one another. If the slope of these linear variation arrays is known, and they are, it should be feasible to determine \"calculated\" values of a particular element-oxide (from different suites or locations) at a constant value of $MgO$. We are thus able to compare the variation in $Na$, rather than the variation due to varying melt proportions. To approximate a fairly primitive basaltic liquid composition, a value of $MgO$ = 8 wt.% is arbitrarily chosen for the value at which the \"calculated\" element-oxides are compared. You will perform this correction now. "

Shear wave velocities ($V_s$) are proxies for mantle potential temperatures, representing the temperature the mantle would have at the surface if it ascended along an adiabat without undergoing melting. This was a concept proposed by [McKenzie & Bickle, 1988](https://academic.oup.com/petrology/article-abstract/29/3/625/1432023) to compare mantle temperatures at different localities. Look at the figure below from the [Dalton et al., 2014](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1249466?casa_token=UxKZ9f8aOVUAAAAA%3A0MvoZnwoItZMA1wm0VhST88T-BCAX6ghGdl3h7OwWl2ZluXh2SKL1ek_409iN7HUa2btCIudbtfqXw) study. $Na_{8.0}$ is replaced by $Na_{90}$, which similarly represents a primitive basaltic liquid, but instead with $Fo$=90 mol.%. Please interpret the physical meaning of this figure. What seismic speeds and potential temperatures do you find with low sodium and high sodium content?\n",

    "##### 11. Finally, let's put all of this together. The [Dalton et al., 2014](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1249466?casa_token=UxKZ9f8aOVUAAAAA%3A0MvoZnwoItZMA1wm0VhST88T-BCAX6ghGdl3h7OwWl2ZluXh2SKL1ek_409iN7HUa2btCIudbtfqXw) study further analyze axial depths and their relationship to potential temperature (or really, shear wave velocity, $V_s$). We plotted the MORB samples and their corresponding axial depths with PyGMT above. Do the potential temperatures pair with depth? If so, why is this? (Hint: Think about crustal thicknesses, isostasy, Archimedes' principal -- how might these explain the observable)\n",

    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have learned some pretty important things about the global geochemical of MORBs, and what their geochemical variation may be telling us about physical conditions within the upper mantle. Of course, there are many additional and complicating factors which we haven't considered during this rather simplistic exercise. For example, how do temperature and pressure differences below the mid-ocean ridges control the melting behavior below the mid-ocean ridges? Additionally, we have totally neglected the important role of mantle plumes and hotspots--several of these features are found along the mid-ocean ridges (e.g., Iceland, the Azores, and the Galapagos), and related samples were included in your dataset that you downloaded from PetDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you have only grazed the surface of this complex topic, you have basically duplicated part of the work published by [Klein and Langmuir, 1987](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JB092iB08p08089) in their classic work on mid-ocean ridge geochemistry, but using a much, much larger dataset!\n",

    "You have successfully worked through this Jupyter notebook."
