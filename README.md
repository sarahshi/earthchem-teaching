The earthchem_teaching repository contain cloud-hosted Python code for visualizing and understanding trends in petrologic data. We explore global chemical variability in mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB), understand variations in mantle melting temperatures, and think about what this all means for crustal thicknesses and seismic velocities.
