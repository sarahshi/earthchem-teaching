    "\n",
    "Computing is an indispensable tool for nearly all geoscientists. Today almost all earth science relies on some form of computation, from simple statistical analysis and curve fitting to advanced numerical simulations. This notebook focuses on data analysis, a subset of computing in which the data already exist, e.g. from observations or from the output of a simulation, but have to be transformed into understanding. There are many different ways to gain understanding, but most workflows often boil down to:\n",
    "- Read data files\n",
    "- Perform analysis, from very simple (e.g. take the mean) to very complex (e.g. train a deep neural network)\n",
    "- Visualize the output in a figure\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook doesn’t attempt to teach deep learning; its goal is to teach the basic foundations of applied data science within the geosciences. This material is designed to be accessible for all undergraduate students, with no prerequisites. \n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "The lessons is designed to give you an introduction to Python programming language with a goal of teaching you commands we will be using in this class. I encourage you to also look at other online tutorials (there are many!). With any programming language, there are almost always multiple ways to accomplish a certain programming task, and some methods are much better than others. It can be helpful to learn from more than one source.\n",

    "## What is Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an open-source programming language that has been in development since the late 1980s. It is a general purpose coding language with a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability with the use of indentation. The Python community is composed of scientists and developers, who openly maintain and develop software packages online with platforms such as GitHub. Therein lies the benefit and beauty of Python, as it ensures the principle of reproducibility, meaning results must be repeatable to be trustworthy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are Python’s way of encapsulating reusable code elements for sharing with others, widely used within the scientific Python ecosystem. Common Python packages include: \n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy: https://github.com/numpy/numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are interactive development environments for notebooks, code, and data. Flexible interfaces allow for users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, machine learning, and beyond. We will be using Jupyter Notebooks for their utility in teaching and tutorials. You can execute code line by line while displaying figures and graphics inline and additionally can intersperse the Python commands with text sections (like this one). We will be using Google Colab, a cloud-based server, to render these Jupyter Notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cells\n",
    "Notebooks are simply a collection of cells. Each cell has a format as either _code_ where you can enter Python commands, or the cell can be text like this one. You can select the cell format using the drop down menu located at the top of the notebook. The text can be formatted as either _raw_, meaning plain ascii text without any formatting, or it can be formatted using the _markdown_ language as done for this cell. _markdown_ is a simple text formatting language. In additional to text formatting, _markdown_ allows you to enter equations using _Latex_ syntax so you can have formatted equations like this: $e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0$ and $\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}$. Here is a [cheatsheet for markdown commands](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) and [instructions in the Jupyter notebook documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entering Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook works by entering commands into cells. You then hit \"shift-return\" to tell Jupyter to execute the commands in the currently selected cell.  By default cells are *Code* cells, where Jupyter expects the cell to contain Python commands. On a Mac, you can type \"option-return\" in a cell and a new cell will be made below.  There are many more options, all of which can be found by exploring the menu bar for you notebook as well as the menubar for JupyterLab. \n"
